            <h1 id="what-is">What is Kryptan?</h1>
                <p>A secure password storage application, for both Windows and Linux. It uses a text-based interface and works great on linux over SSH, as well as a standalone Windows desktop application.</p>
                <p>List of features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All passwords are stored using industrial grade encryption. (256-bit AES)</li>
                    <li>Retrieval of passwords needs a decryption key. (MASTER-KEY)</li>
                    <li>Local standalone application. (No internet access is neccesary)</li>
                    <li>Multi platform. Works on both Windows and Linux.</li>
                    <li>Password file that's platform independent (radable by both Windows and Linux versions).</li>
                    <li>Interface designed to minimze so called shoulder surfing</li>
                    <li>OpenSource</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h1 id="download">Where to get it? (DOWNLOAD)</h1>
                <p>Precompiled windows binaries are available <a href="https://github.com/alex-caelus/kryptan/releases">here</a>.</p>
                <p>For Linux I recommend that you build directly from the source-code, see below for instructions.</p>
            
            <h1 id="get-source">Where do I get the source-code?</h1>
                <p>The Bitbucket project is located <a href="https://github.com/alex-caelus/kryptan">here</a>, or you can download the source below:</p>
            
            <h1 id="compile-source">How do I compile the source-code?</h1>
                <p>You need to download and install the following prerequisites:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Crypto++</dt>
					<dd>Crypto++, see <a href="http://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Compiling">http://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Compiling</a> for installation instructions for your platform. download it here: <a href="http://www.cryptopp.com/#download">http://www.cryptopp.com/#download</a></dd>
					
					<dt>(Linux only) Ncurses</dt>
					<dd>It should probably already be installed. Please consult your distributions documentatian regarding installation instructions.</dd>
					
					<dt>(Windows only) Pdcurses win32a</dt>
					<dd>Compilation can be a bit tricky, but read the instructions on the download page: <a href="http://www.projectpluto.com/win32a.htm#download">http://www.projectpluto.com/win32a.htm#download</a></dd>
					
					<dt>(all platforms) Boost</dt>
					<dd>Please download and compile boost for your platform and add it to the include paths</dd>
				</dl>
				
				<h2>Linux instructions</h2>
				<p>Make sure you have the gcc build suite installed and operational, and the above requirements installed where gcc can find them. After that just <b>cd</b> into the build/ directory an type <b>make</b> on the console. If everything went smoothly the binary should be located in the dist/ directory</p>
				
				<h2>Windows instructions (Visual studio 2013)</h2>
				<p>Open the file kryptan.sln with Visual studio. Open the project properties window and browse to "Configuration Properies -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories" and change the value to where you have installed the the pdcurses, cryptopp and boost directories. Next browse to "Configuration Properies -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories" and change the value to include both the pdcurses/win32a, cryptopp/Win32/Output/Release and boost/stage directories.</p>
				<p>Close the project property window and build the project, if everything went smoothly the binary should be located in the Release directory.</p>
            
            <h1 id="use-it">How do I use Kryptan?</h1>
                <p>Hopefully the program should be rather self explanatory, but here is some useful information:</p>
				
				<h2>Copy paste (Windows)</h2>
					<p>Copy/paste works a little bit differently than on normal windows applications.</p>
					<p>To paste in a new password or uesrname, simply press the button "paste" in the menu above the main screen.</p>
					<p>To copy a word, all you need is to select it. No CTRL+C is neccessary! To select a word drag the mouse pointer over it, alternatively you can double click on the text you want to select.</p>
                
            <h1 id="report-bugs">Where do i report bugs/feature requests?</h1>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/alex-caelus/kryptan/issues">Here</a>, please check wheather or not a simmilar issue/request already exists before you posts</p>
            
            <h1 id="contribute">How do I contribute?</h1>
                <p>Visit the github project located <a href="https://github.com/alex-caelus/kryptan/">here</a> and make a fork of it, make any changes you want and then make a pull request and I'll look into it :).</p>
				<p>Alternatively you can send the author an email (Alexander Nilsson: alex.caelus (at) gmail.com) and we can discuss it further.</p>
